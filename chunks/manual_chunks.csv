R30iA_Maintenance,3.5,77,SRVO-062,TROUBLESHOOTING,HIGH,false,,"SRVO-062 BZAL alarm (Group: i  Axis: j). This alarm occurs if battery for Pulsecoder absolute-position backup is empty. A probable cause is a broken battery cable or no batteries in the robot. (Action 1) Replace the battery in the battery box of the robot base. (Action 2) Replace the Pulsecoder with which an alarm has been issued. (Action 3) Check whether the robot internal cable for feeding power from the battery to the Pulsecoder is not disconnected and grounded. If an abnormality is found, replace the cable."
R30iA_Maintenance,3.5,77,SRVO-062,SAFETY,HIGH,true,,"CAUTION: After correcting the cause of this alarm, set the system variable ($MCR.$SPC_RESET) to TRUE then turn on the power again. Mastering is needed."
R30iA_Maintenance,3.5,87,SRVO-214,TROUBLESHOOTING,HIGH,false,"Part II 3.6","SRVO-214 Fuse blown (Servo amplifier). A fuse in the servo amplifier has blown. In case that FS2 or FS3 is blown (Action 1) A fuse is blown, eliminate the cause, and then replace the fuse. (See Section 3.6 in the Part II, “MAINTENANCE”.) (Action 2) Replace the servo amplifier."
R30iA_Maintenance,3.5,80,SRVO-084,TROUBLESHOOTING,MEDIUM,false,"SRVO-062","SRVO-084 BZAL alarm (Track enc: i). This alarm occurs if the backup battery for the absolute position of the Pulsecoder has not been connected. See the description about the BZAL alarm (SRVO-062)."
R30iA_Maintenance,3.5,97,"SRVO-300/302",TROUBLESHOOTING,MEDIUM,false,"Part III 5.5.3","SRVO-300 Hand broken/HBK disabled / SRVO-302 Set Hand broken to ENABLE. Although HBK was disabled, the HBK signal was input. (Action 1) Press RESET on the teach pendant to release the alarm. (Action 2) Check whether the hand broken signal is connected to the robot. When the hand broken signal circuit is connected, enable hand broken. (See Subsection 5.5.3 in Part III, “CONNECTIONS”.)"
R30iA_Maintenance,3.5,65,SRVO-018,TROUBLESHOOTING,HIGH,false,,"SRVO-018 Brake abnormal. An excessive brake current is detected. The ALM LED on the servo amplifier is lit. (Action 1) Check the cables and motor brakes connected to CRR88 connector on the servo amplifier. If a short-circuit or grounding fault is found, replace the failed part. (Action 2) Check the cables and motor brakes connected to CRR88 connector on the servo amplifier. If a short-circuit or grounding fault is found, replace the failed part. (Action 3) Replace the servo amplifier."
R30iA_Maintenance,3.5,65,SRVO-018,SAFETY,HIGH,true,,"CAUTION: This error can be caused by the optional brake release unit if the on/off switch is left in on position while the operator attempts to jog the robot. To recover, turn the brake release unit off and cycle the controller power."
