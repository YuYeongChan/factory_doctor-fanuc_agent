R30iA_Maintenance,3.5,69,SRVO-043,TROUBLESHOOTING,MEDIUM,false,,"(23) SRVO-043 DCAL alarm (Group: i Axis: j) (Explanation) The regenerative discharge energy was too high to be dissipated as heat. (To run the robot, the servo amplifier supplies energy to the robot. When going down the vertical axis, the robot operates from the potential energy. If a reduction in the potential energy is higher than the energy needed for acceleration, the servo amplifier receives energy from the motor. A similar phenomenon occurs even when no gravity is applied, for example, at deceleration on a horizontal axis. The energy that the servo amplifier receives from the motor is called the regenerative energy. The servo amplifier dissipates this energy as heat. If the regenerative energy is higher than the energy dissipated as heat, the difference is stored in the servo amplifier, causing an alarm.) (Action 1) This alarm may occur if the axis is subjected to frequent acceleration/deceleration or if the axis is vertical and generates a large amount of regenerative energy. If this alarm has occurred, relax the service conditions. (Action 2) Check fuse FS3 in the servo amplifier. If it has blown, remove the cause, and replace the fuse. One of the probable causes of a blown fuse is a ground fault in the servo amplifier for the auxiliary axis. (Action 3) The ambient temperature is excessively high. Or the regenerative resistor can't be cooled effectively. Check the fan unit, and replace it if it stops. Clean up the fun unit, the regenerative resistor and the louver if they are dirty. (Action 4) Make sure that the phase-to-phase voltages of input power fall within the specified range by measurement. If the voltages are out of the range, inspect the power equipment. When no failure is found, replace the E-stop unit. (Action 5) Make sure that the servo amplifier CRR63A and CRR63B connectors are connected tightly. Then detach the cable from CRR63A and CRR63B connectors on the Servo amplifier, and check for continuity between pins 1 and 2 of the cable-end connector. If there is no continuity between the pins, replace the regenerative resistor. (Action 6) Make sure that the servo amplifier CRR45A and CRR45B are connected tightly, then detach the cables from CRR45A and CRR45B on the servo amplifier and check the resistance between pins 1 and 2 of each cable end connector. If the resistance is not 9-16!, replace the regenerative resistor. CRR45B may not be used depending on the robot model. (Action 7) Replace the servo amplifier. - 32 -"
